# RNStarter
React-Native project scaffold after running `react-native init ProjectName`

Install dependencies with:
`yarn add babel-plugin-transform-remove-console prop-types react-native-router-flux react-redux redux redux-logger redux-persist redux-thunk`
(assuming that you already have react and react-native installed automatically by the installer)
